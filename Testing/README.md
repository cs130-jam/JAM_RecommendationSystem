# Testing
Testing1 - for unit testing the given test cases in test1.py file covers 100% paths, branches and statements

Testing2 - For Machine learning algorithms it is important to test the effectiveness of the algo. Since we didn't have any tagged data, in order to test the effectivenes for a give user and user's music interests we generated the recommendation from our algorithm and we also generated recommendation randomly. we looked at the top 10 recommendations generated by both the methods and matched it with user interests. Recommended users generated by our algorithm were very similar to the given users which showed that the Algorithm is effective in recommending the similar music artists.
